[NextCloudPi](https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/) is a great project which provides ready-to-run images to run NextCloud on a Raspberry Pi.
My favorite models are the 3B (**without** the plus) and the Zero W, because of their efficiency.
I'll use a Raspberry Pi 3B for this project. It can be powered by an ordinary power bank.

My goal is to have a cloud service which is:

- easy to connect to
- energy-efficient
- and portable

# General setup

1. Extract image to SD card (I've used [Ether](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), although I hate electron)
1. Connect your Pi to your network via cable
1. Browse the URL of the Pi
1. Run the activation steps and note the passwords

# Changing the passwords

Now I've changed the passwords:

- Nextcloud's default admin account, named *ncp*
- NextCloudPi's admin console user, also named *ncp*
- And I've enabled SSH and changed the password (note: you need to change it again after the first login)

# Setup Wi-Fi hotspot

There's a good documentation [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md) about how to setup Wi-Fi with a Raspberry Pi.

Here's what I did differently:

- `sudo apt install hostapd` (dnsmasq was already installed)
- Extend `dhcp-range` to .200, to allow more than 20 concurrent clients
- `sudo systemctl enable dnsmasq` after `sudo systemctl start dnsmasq`: That was missing, and is needed to make dhcp work after reboot
- Add `192.168.4.1 nextcloudpi` to */etc/hosts*: You will be able to type in `nextcloudpi` in the browser instead of the IP
- `sudo reboot` at the end and you should be presented a new Wi-Fi network to connect to :)
