    Relaunch. Worked in a team of ~30 people from eight different countries, most of them from ThoughtWorks.
    At first, my goal was to integrate OpenAM into their platform to let people authenticate by Username/Password, IP address or via Shibboleth (SAML 2.0).

    Later, I've joined the Scala development team. The website offers thousands of scientific books, which can be searched, previewed, bought and downloaded.
    Strictly test-driven. Weekly, automated releases.
