    The previous contractor deleted the original sources and formatted the laptop.
    There were still some outdated, incomplete sources in the VCS.
    My job was to fix a bug in the production system, and it was a mixture of reverse-engineer
    the existing production binary and combining it with the sources.

    Together with a specialist from Czech Republic we managed to transfer the project back to a stable,
    tested state.

    Extend Central Authentication Service (CAS) with a new authentication method

    Due to a new format of customer ids, the CAS needed to be modified to allow a login
    with these new numbers. Additionally, the login via the old customer ids should still work.

    - Implementation of the new login method
    - Care about the correct logout (a third-party system needed to be informed about the logout)
    - Handle special cases correctly (timeout, already logged in, wrong password, etc.)

    Relaunch. Worked in a team of ~30 people from eight different countries, most of them from ThoughtWorks.
    At first, my goal was to integrate OpenAM into their platform to let people authenticate by Username/Password, IP address or via Shibboleth (SAML 2.0).

    Later, I've joined the Scala development team. The website offers thousands of scientific books, which can be searched, previewed, bought and downloaded.
    Strictly test-driven. Weekly, automated releases.
