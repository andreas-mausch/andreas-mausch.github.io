This is a code block:

```
Some generic code
Some very long line, which shouldn't cause horizontal scrolling on mobile.
```

This is a normal paragraph with `some very long inline code command, which should also not cause horizontal scrolling`.

```java
public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Some Java Code");
  }
}
```

```kotlin
fun main() {
  println("Some Kotlin Code")
}
```

```bash
$ echo "This is a bash command"
```
