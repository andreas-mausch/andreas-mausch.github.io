I planned to write this post way earlier, and I will extend it from time to time.

I have benefited so much from free software I just want to share why.

My personal perception of software is either "It works as expected" or
"it has bugs and flaws".
So if a software behaves as the user expected it to, that's almost the best case
scenario, which is rarely even appreciated.

So I want to give examples, which you may have experienced yourself, where software
**does not do** what the user expected.
And I want to show how it would make a difference, if these projects happened to be open source.

In the second part of this post I want to share the power of software which works even
without an internet connection.
Even though I do have a very stable connection and cannot complain about bad internet,
I still love the feeling of independent / autarkic software, which guarantees it will
run tomorrow the same way it runs today.

# Ugly examples of closed source software

## Apple iPod Touch

Hardware still in good shape, but almost no internet service is working anymore,
I cannot update the firmware (?) and cannot connect to the AppStore.

## Hewlett-Packard printer firmware

## Windows' forced Auto-Update

## Windows' forced Microsoft Account

## Samsung Tizen Smartwatch

## Software support in general / Android updates / LineageOS

# And would open source be better?

# Offline data

## OsmAnd / OpenStreetMap

## Wikipedia / Kiwix
