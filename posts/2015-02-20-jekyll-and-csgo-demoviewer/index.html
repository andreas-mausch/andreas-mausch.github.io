<h1>Blog post: Jekyll and CS:GO Demoviewer</h1>



<p>Today I have set up Jekyll and did some work on my new project, the CS:GO Demoviewer.</p>
<p>CS:GO Demoviewer will be a tool to quickly review .dem files of the game Counter-Strike Global Offensive rendered in 2D. Development just started and I have a lot of ideas in mind to implement.
Below a screenshot of a very early version:</p>

<p>Furthermore I am working on another tool for CS:GO, which will also parse a .dem file and output all highlights of it. Currently it shows the round number of rounds where a player got at least 3 frags and also clutches, when a lonely player left on his team won the round in 1vsX.</p>
