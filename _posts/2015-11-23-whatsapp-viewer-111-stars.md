Today I have received the 111th star on WhatsApp Viewer on github.
I am still surprised by the spread of the application.
I get lots of emails regarding key recovery, bugs and new features.
Even though I have not worked on WhatsApp Viewer for a few months, download numbers are continual and a lot of people are interested in the app.

Thank you very much.
