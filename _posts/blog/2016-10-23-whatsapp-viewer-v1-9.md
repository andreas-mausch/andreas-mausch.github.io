I have released a new version of WhatsApp Viewer, get it here:

[Download WhatsApp Viewer v1.9](https://github.com/andreas-mausch/whatsapp-viewer/releases)

Thanks to TripCode, who released source code to decrypt the crypt12 file format:

See details about the format here:

Additionally, WhatsApp Viewer now supports exporting a chat to a .json file.
Thumbnails of images are stored as base64.
